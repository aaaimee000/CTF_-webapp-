# CTF Web App (SQLi & XSS Challenges)

A vulnerable web application designed for Capture The Flag (CTF) practice, featuring SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) challenges.

The website is hosted on Render at this link: https://ctf-webapp.onrender.com/

## Overview
- **SQL Injection Challenge**: Bypass login to retrieve a hidden flag. Both key, hash and video will be returned if SQL injection is done correctly.
- **XSS Challenge**: XSS is only a confusion to the participants.


## Challenges & Flags
### 1. SQL Injection
#### when doing it properly as a hacker
1. enter username as admin
2. enter password as ' UNION SELECT (SELECT decryption_key FROM keys_table LIMIT 1), NULL, NULL, NULL -- 
3. it will return you with the decrypytion Key, the location of the video, and the flag.

#### how do they know the number of fields? BY TRYING, because the prompt will tell them. 
1. If they did less than the fields, e.g.,
' UNION SELECT (SELECT decryption_key FROM keys_table LIMIT 1), NULL, NULL --

It will return " Error: SELECTs to the left and right of UNION do not have the same number of result columns", prompting them to reduce or increase the number of fields. 

#### if you did it without knowing username/pwd
1. enter wrong username or wrong password, it will tell you "ACCESS DENIED: Insufficient clearance."

#### if you did it with knowing username/pwd, incorrectly or with the most basic sql injection 
1. enter username as admin, or ' OR '1'='1
2. enter password as password123, ' OR '1'='1
3. it will return you a wrong flag, it will display: Flag: admin | Access /get_video?id=1 
(!!You get the place of the video, but clearly the flag is still incorrect since you cannot use it to decrypt the video.)



#### File Setup Instructions
* Encrypt the Video:

openssl aes-256-cbc -e -in secret_video.mp4 -out secret_video.enc -k "OMNI_AI_VIDEO_KEY_619"

* Place secret_video.enc in your project folder.

* Update init_db() to insert the encrypted video (code provided above).



### 2. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) HONEYPOT-LIKE FUNCTION
- **Objective**: Steal the cookie containing the flag.
- **Exploit**: 
  - Submit `<svg/onload="alert(document.cookie)">` as a comment.
  - **MESSAGE**: `Gotchu - message that guide them to look into database` 

## Security Notes
- üîí **Isolation**: Run this app in a VM/Docker container or disposable environment.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Reset Database**: Delete `ctf.db` and restart the app to clear data:
  ```bash
  rm ctf.db && python3 app.py
  ```
- üö´ **Never expose this app to the public internet**.
```

# CTF Walkthrough

1. Perform SQL Injection

- Extract the encryption key from keys_table.
- Extract the video ID (1) from videos table.
2. Retrieve the Encrypted Video

- Access /get_video?id=1 and download secret_video.enc.
3. Decrypt the Video Using OpenSSL

- openssl aes-256-cbc -d -in secret_video.enc -out secret_video.mp4 -k "OMNI_AI_VIDEO_KEY_619" 

[NOTE: this key "OMNI_AI_VIDEO_KEY_619" can be replaced with hash]

4. Watch the Decrypted Video (secret_video.mp4, ie, flag 4)

5. Open secret_video.mp4 and find the next hint.


# WHAT DO WE NEED TO GIVE THEM HINT -- can be included in the brief
1. tell them some basic information to get them started: username is admin, password is password123, and there are four tables in the web app, their names are users, keys_table, videos, and comments. The users table structure is 
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    username TEXT UNIQUE,
    password TEXT,
    flag TEXT
)
2. In hints, we can tell them what encryption the video is encrypted in  -- aes-256-cbc

# Things for ourselves in submission
1. See the CTF Walkthrough above. Both key and hash are included. 
2. XSS is only a confusion to the participants.



TODO Update:
#### DONE experiment with video encrypt, then serve it on webapp
#### DONE Hosting on Render
#### DONE need to see what exactly is the decryption key
#### next flag--   XSS
#### DONE frontend of sql  (when i have time i can put in a little jif on sql space, update the time part)
#### DONE put the hash below the SQL return line.
#### DONE make the time longer 



--------------
Final CTF Flow
SQLi Challenge:

Extract decryption key from keys_table.

Use key to decrypt video for the final flag.

XSS Challenge:

Bypass <script> filtering to steal the cookie. For example, submit <svg/onload="alert(document.cookie)">

Both challenges are independent (no dependency between them).
